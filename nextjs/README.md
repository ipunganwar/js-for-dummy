# Basics & Foundations (Introducting Key Features)
## File-based Routing
### The special /pages folder
 NextJS will automatically look inside this folder to serving component

 #### How File-based routing works
  - /pages
    - index.js  --> Main starting page (my-domain.com/)
    - about.js  --> About page (my-domain.com/about)
    - /products
      - index.js --> All products page (my-domain.com/products)
      - [id].js --> Product detail page --> All products page (my-domain.com/products/1)
